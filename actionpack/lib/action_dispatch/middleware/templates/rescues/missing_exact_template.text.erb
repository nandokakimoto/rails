Template is missing

<%= @exception.message %>

<%= render template: "rescues/_request_and_response", format: :text %>

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally
respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're
loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to
actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an
error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.
That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.

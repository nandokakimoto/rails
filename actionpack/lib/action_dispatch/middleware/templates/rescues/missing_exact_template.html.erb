    NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally
    respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're
    loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to
    actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an
    error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.
    That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.
